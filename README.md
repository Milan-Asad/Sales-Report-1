## FINDINGS:
### Clicks By Month
It is on a downward trend. April represents the peak with 1.6 million clicks. The downward trend could be due to many reasons such as seasonal changes 

### COST VS REVENUE BY MONTH:
In addition to the peak amount of clicks, April generated the most revenue. May generated some revenue, but not as much as April. June was a disaster, representing a loss.

### USER ENGAGEMENT BY BANNER:
Self-explanatory. Medium-sized banners are the best performers, followed by small-sized banners. Large banners have the worst performance. This can be due to many reasons, such as the size simply being too distracting and off-putting.

### REVENUE & USER ENGAGEMENT BY BANNER SIZE AND CAMPAIGN NUMBER
N/A

### REVENUE BY DAY AND CAMPAIGN NUMBER
Overall we can see campaign 1 outperforms all other campaigns. We also see little revenue generated by campaigns 2 and 3, with campaign 3 virtually generating nothing (in comparison to 1). Reasons can be due to factors such as exhaustion and "campaign fatigue"
